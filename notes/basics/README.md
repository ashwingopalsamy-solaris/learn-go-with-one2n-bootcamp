# Tour of Go

## Notes

### Basics:
- Variables declared inside an `if short` statement will also be available in `else` blocks.
- Order of Evaluation in Function Arguments:
    - In Go, function arguments are evaluated before the function is called.
    - Go determines the order of evaluation of function arguments by evaluating them from **left to right** before the function call, as specified in the language specification.
    - In languages like C, C++, Java there is no definite specification that mentions on the order of evaluation of function arguments.
    - In Python, the order of evaluation of function arguments is similar to Go.
- In `switch` statement, Go runs only the first successful case and inserts the `break` automatically, unlike C, C++, Java & JS.
- `defer` calls are evaluated immediately but the function call is not executed until the surrounding function returns.
- Deferred function calls are pushed onto a stack. When a function returns, its deferred calls are executed in **last-in-first-out** order.
- `Slices` are like references to `arrays`, when you create a slice from an existing array - you are essentially interacting wit the underlying array.
- Zero value of a `slice` is `nil`.

### Methods and Interfaces:
- In Go, a method is just a function with receiver argument.
- One cannot declare a method with a receiver whose type is defined in another package (including internal packages).
- Interfaces are implemented implicitly in Go. There is no `implements` keyword.

### Channels and Go-Routines:
- Once a channel is created with a specific capacity, that capacity remains fixed for the lifetime of the channel.
- 'Resizing' of a channel can be done dynamically during runtime, by creating a new channel with desired capacity and moving the elements from old channel to new.
- `cap` keyword is used to fetch the capacity of a channel.
